## Guide: Adding a new example

The examples folder is now backed by a Test Framework which requires certain files exist within a Directory. For the tests to run, the following files must exist:

- `main.tf` - which contains the code for the example
- `README.md` - which contains an summary of what will be provisioned
- `variables.tf` - which contains all of the variables used in this example

Other files and directories may exist in this directory, such as any sub-modules; however there must be no `provider` or `terraform` blocks specified in the example - since these will be generated by the test framework (and this will conflict).
